Last semester (Fall 99) the applicant took my class "Mathematical Methods in Physics",
a first year graduate course primarily designed for incoming graduate students in Physics. 
Micky was a very attentive and serious student. Being the only engineering student in my
class, his background made it necessary for him to put more work in than the other students. 
Therefore, my overall personal judgement of him is better than the final grade (B+) would make it 
seem. His work was consistent and thorough, and his performance was quite satisfactory.
He works well both in groups and by himself. His personality is very pleasant.

If I had to make a prediction, I would say that he is definitely capable of sound graduate work
and I expect him to obtain a good professional doctoral degree.
