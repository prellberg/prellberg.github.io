<p>The Farey Fraction Spin Chain</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>The Farey Fraction Spin Chain is a set of one-dimensional statistical
mechanical models built on the Farey fractions (modified Farey
sequence).  These models lie between statistical mechanics and number
theory, and are of interest in both areas.  A direct connection to
dynamical systems is used to prove that the models rigorously exhibit
a (barely) second-order phase transition.  Additionally, one may
calculate certain correlation functions.  The phase diagram,
including an external magnetic field, is determined by means of
renormalization group and also via a (dynamical system inspired)
cluster approximation.  The results, interestingly, are almost
consistent. Examination of the partition function at the critical
point suggests a subtle, apparently new, property of the Farey
fractions.  There are also rigorous results by number theorists for
the "density of states"  and a close connection to the Lewis three-
term equation, extensively studied in the theory of the Selberg zeta-
function.
