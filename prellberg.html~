<p>Combinatorial Enumeration of Two-Dimensional Vesicles - a Review</p>

<p>Thomas Prellberg, QMUL</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>I discuss two-dimensional lattice models of closed fluctuating membranes,
or vesicles. The underlying mathematical model is that of self-avoiding
polygons and their enumeration by perimeter and area.  By adding the
constraint of partial directedness, one gets solvable models in the sense
that an explicit expression for the generating function can be given in
terms of alternating $q$-series. An asymptotic analysis leads to an
explicit calculation of the scaling behaviour around the critical point in
terms of the Airy function.
