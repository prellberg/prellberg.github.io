<p>Disproving things is easier when you know they are false - experimenting with two conjectures on pattern-avoiding permutations</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>
When I started my PhD I learnt many new mathematical ideas and
techniques. Perhaps the most important of these was

"It is always easier to prove something when you know it is true."</p><p>

I have used this idea a great deal in my work; computer aided number
crunching has paved the way to many of my results. Recently I was
introduced the problem of counting pattern-avoiding permutations.
This problem arises in different contexts in computer science and
algebra. In the last decade or so it has been subject to a great deal
of work and a number of conjectures have been made. Some of these have
recently been proved, but much work remains to be done.</p><p>

In this talk I will give a general discussion of pattern-avoiding
permutations before focussing on some of the experimental work I have
done which led me to realise (but not prove) that two open conjectures
were false. Thankfully it *is* easier to disprove something when you
know it is false, and I will show you how we disproved one conjecture
and some of our work towards disproving the other.</p>
