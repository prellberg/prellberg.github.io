<br>
Authors have analyzed the phase diagram of the configurational phases
of a polymer chain with one end attached to the surface. The main focus
seems to rely on distinction between figs 3(a) and 3(b), i.e., the
surface attached globule (SAG) and fully detached globule (FDG) as a
function of the interaction parameters ww and wp. They seem to have
estimated the number of visited sites (scaled and its variance) on the
wall by the chain for different values of these interactions.
Conformation and density profiles of homo-polymer chains are
extensively studied (e.g., work by Binder and co.). This analysis of
the phase diagram is a good start; however, the work presented as it is
appears a bit speculative (even with a relatively lengthy description).
For example, authors have frequently described the conformations of the
chain using such terminologies as collapsed, extended, surface attached
globule, but no analysis of the radius of gyration (Rg) of the chain is
presented to augment these claims. A more detailed analysis is highly
desirable for the conformation of the chain as a function of
interaction strengths (even for the nearest neighbor interaction they
seem to have considered) and temperature to clearly show various
conformational phases including liquid phase of the chain. Some of my
specific remarks follow.<br>
<br>
1. Page 4 &#8216;In [8, 9, 10] it was &#8230; the Desorbed-Extended phase. We shall
refer to this second situation as the &#8220;Fully Detached Globule&#8221; &#8216;. Why
it is globule if detached extended? Definition of globule with explicit
scaling of Rg with its size will help clarifying this issue. <br>
2. Page 5 &#8216;Let us consider the lines ww = 1.3 (attractive wall visits)
and ww = 0.8 (repulsive wall visits).&#8217; it would be good to point out
the interaction strength and temperature explicitly.<br>
3.	page 5 &#8216; Hence the (finite-size location) &#8230; phase).&#8217;, not clear from fig. 4.<br>
4. In figure 5, is y-label &#8216;scaled visits&#8217; or just the mean number of
visits? Conformation of chain will depend on the polymer-wall
interaction. &#8216;We conclude &#8230; wp = 0.8.&#8217;, please provide Rg profile to
augment this conclusion. As mentioned above, it would be good to
scaling of Rg with n to judge how the globule and extended
conformations set in.<br>
5.	Just before the last sentence on page 6 &#8216; While &#8230; correction exponent used to do the extrapolation.&#8217; appears vague.<br>
6.	In figure 7, is wp = 1.0 attractive? Which one (7(a), 7(b)) to take (&#61540; = 0 or 2/3)?<br>
7.	Rg for corresponding figs. 8 and 9 should be presented.<br>
8. Last sentence (page 8) &#8216;It is entirely possible however that much
longer polymer lengths need to be considered before the surface phase
diagram can be conclusively delineated.&#8217; what is then the conclusion?
