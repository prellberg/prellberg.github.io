<A HREF="papers/pub116.pdf">"Adsorption of interacting self-avoiding trails in two dimensions"</A><P>

Lattice trails in two dimensions are a greatly simplified system that can give insight into the complex phase diagram of polymer adsorption on a surface. The authors simulate three different adsorption scenarios in this system, and study the resulting phases and phase boundaries as well as the critical exponents.<P>

<A HREF="papers/pub045.pdf">"Flat histogram version of the pruned and
enriched Rosenbluth method"</A><P>

Referee A:

This paper makes a significant contribution to the means and methods of
simulating random structures, such as walks, on a regular lattice by
computer. The letter is easy to read and explains the relevant techniques
and issue clearly. (...)<P>

Referee B:

The paper presents an interesting extension of the Grassberg-Rosenbluth
method (PERM), which appears to me <B>superior to the recently published
extension of PERM by Bachmann and Janke</B>.

The presentation is very clear and also suitable for a broader
readership. (...)

<A HREF="papers/pub041.pdf">"Proof of a monotonicity conjecture"</A><P>

This is a wonderfully succinct paper fully settling
a conjecture that has been open for nine years and has been
studied widely. <B>The theorem is beautiful and the proof is
exquisite.</B><P>

I strongly recommend publication in the Journal of Combinatorial
Theory, Series A.<P>
