<b>Simulation of the HP-model of protein folding:</b>
The HP-model, which has rightfully been called the "Ising model of protein folding," serves as a benchmark model for testing the performance
of algorithms attempting to compute the density of states of proteins close to their folded ground state. This model provides an 
ideal testing ground for the comparison of new Monte-Carlo algorithms with established ones.
<p></p>
<b>The melting transition of a polymeric crystal:</b>
There has been a long-lasting controversy about the order of the melting transition of polymeric crystals. In two dimensions, there are conflicting
statements in the literature, and details may very well depend on the precise lattice model studied. There is therefore
continuing need for high-quality simulations in this area. 
<p></p>
<b>Exact solution of two partially directed walk models in a slit:</b>
Lattice models of one or many partially directed self-avoiding walks (PDSAW) in a slit interacting with the walls will be studied by deriving exact solutions
to their combinatorial generating function using the so-called kernel method for solving combinatorial functional equations.
This can be done by studying more and more elaborate problems, and comparing and contrasting work on Dyck and Motzkin paths 
with work on PDSAW. 
<p></p>
<b>Directed vesicle models in restricted geometries:</b>
Inclusion of area weights into directed walk models generally leads to q-deformed special functions, and it
is planned to study the q-deformation of kernel method for the simplest cases for which the solution is well-understood,
but that have not yet been studied with the proposed new approach. Starting with the model of Dyck paths enumerated with
respect to length and enclosed area, we will gradually develop expertise for tackling more complicated models.

My main research is concerned with problems from enumerative combinatorics, usually in
the guise of lattice models in statistical mechanics. Here, my activities have 
ranged from rigorous combinatorial and asymptotic work to the development of Monte Carlo algorithms.
<p></p>
A brief selection from my past research highlights is given by (a) a seminal paper on intermittent
maps, (b) a uniform sampling algorithm based on stochastic growth, (c) the Takeuchi-Prellberg
constant occurring in iterative functional equations, (d) work in uniform asymptotic analysis characterised
by experts as a tour-de-force calculation, and (e) a record numerical estimate of a self-avoiding walk exponent.
<p></p>
I am strongly embedded within a wide international research network. 
Examples of current active research collaborations include work on numbertheoretic 
spin chains with Peter Kleban from the University of Maine (where I spent a sabbatical 
term in 2008 as Visiting Professor of Diversity), an analysis of 
functional equations arising in the enumeration of lattice walks with 
Andrew Rechnitzer from the University of British Columbia and Buks van Rensburg 
from York University, and asymptotic analysis of physically motivated lattice 
models of polymers with Aleks Owczarek from the University of Melbourne. Other 
recent work includes enumerative combinatorics of quiver structures in cluster algebras 
with Martin Rubey from the University of Hannover.
<p></p>
Having a background in both physics and mathematics allows me to draw from 
a larger range of collaborators, both internally and externally. In addition to 
having done work with several eminent combinatorialists, I have also successfully
collaborated with experimental physical chemists and condensed matter physicists. 
Furthermore, I am equally at home at statistical physics workshops and combinatorics 
conferences: as early as 2002 I presented a plenary talk at FPSAC, a conference on 
formal power series and algebraic combinatorics. Indeed, I have frequently been invited 
to give talks at international conferences and summer schools in both mathematics and 
physics. In 2008 I gave a lecture series on techniques in enumerative combinatorics 
at a summer school at the Schr\"odinger Institute in Austria, and I am invited
to give a lecture series on stochastic enumeration algorithms at a 2011 summer 
school on the simulation of extreme events.
<p></p>
My international interests are not limited to conferences. I
have received very positive referee feedback (a rare
occurrence in Germany) on my final report for my last large grant from the
German Science Foundation (DFG) on the development of stochastic enumeration
algorithms. Part of this grant enabled me to employ a post-doctoral researcher 
which culminated in very successful results. 
As special recognition I have also been bestowed the title of
Professor (Ausserplanmaessiger Professor) by Clausthal
University of Technology. A large part of my research over the past six
years has been supported by the ARC Centre of Excellence on the Mathematics and 
Statistics of Complex Systems (MASCOS) in Australia, funding for which is 
currently coming to an end.
<p></p>
Besides Australia, Germany, the US and the UK, I have also held
research positions in Norway and Israel. Because each of these
countries has slightly different university systems I have accumulated
considerable experience in teaching ranging from first-year to
post-graduate level, and in supervising student's honours and postgraduate
work. 
<p></p>
In 2006 I developed and taught a new calculus course
which incorporates web-based learning software; in this, I was supported by an
e-learning fellowship grant. I have also supervised a post-graduate student on 
the topic of non-Markovian random walks on random graphs, and am regularly asked 
to act as PhD examiner. I am active in key roles of departmental administration, such
as postgraduate exam board chair or senior tutor, and I have been elected to serve on the
Senate of Queen Mary.
