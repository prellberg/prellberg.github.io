<p>Exactly solvable models of walks: limit distributions for counting parameters</p>

<p>Christoph Richard, University of Bielefeld</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>We discuss several classes of directed square lattice walks, which
are discrete counterparts of stochastic objects like Browian motion
and Brownian excursions. We derive limit distributions for certain
counting parameters associated to these walks and compare the results
to a stochastic description. To a major extent, this talk will
review known techniques and results from enumerative combinatorics
and singularity analysis of generating functions.</p>
