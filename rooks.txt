Dear Sylvie,

I just touched the computer to send you an email...

What I have done today (apart from teaching 5 hours) is to write up cleanly the
things I know, and I looked at Heaps of Pieces again, but found that I cannot
see the weak exceedances in the polyominoes resulting from the decomposition
analogous to Penaud's.

I'll first send you what I have so far, then read and digest your email.  I'll
send you this stuff in LaTeX, maybe this saves us some typing.

\begin{document}
A \Dfn{bicoloured Motzkin path} is a path starting at the origin, taking
north-east, south-east, east and coloured east steps, returning to the $x$-axis
but never going below it.  The \Dfn{height} of a step is the $y$-coordinate of
the point where it ends, and we allow a non-negative weight on every step as
follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] south-east steps and east steps have weight at most as big as their
  height, and
\item[] north-east steps and coloured east steps have weight less than their
  height.
\end{itemize}
Note that this implies that coloured east steps must have height greater than
zero.  Such paths are also referred to as \lq histoires de Laguerre\rq.  An
example of such a path is given in Figure~\ref{fig:Motzkin}.  For brevity, we
will refer to weighted Motzkin paths always simply as \lq Motzkin paths\rq.

We want to determine the generating function for Motzkin paths with $n$ steps,
according to the number of (uncoloured) east and north-east steps, marked be
$y$, and weight, marked by $q$.

There is a simple bijection, due to Dominique Foata and Doron Zeilberger that
maps permutations to weighted bicoloured Motzkin paths.  This bijection
transforms the number of crossings of the permutation, as defined by Sylvie
Corteel, into the total weight of the path.  Moreover, it transforms the number
of weak exceedances into the number of east and north-east steps.

\begin{itemize}
\item collect the weighted Motzkin paths with the same underlying Motzkin path,
  so we obtain Motzkin paths where
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[] south-east steps and east steps have weight $1+q+\dots+q^{h-1}$, and
  \item[] north-east steps and coloured east steps have weight
    $1+q+\dots+q^{h-2}$, if $h$ is the height of the step.
  \end{itemize}

\item transform the Motzkin paths into weighted Dyck paths of lenght $2n$:
  (classic)

  The number of weak exceedances corresponds to the number of south-east steps
  at even height in the Dyck path.  The weight of a north-east step equals one,
  the weight of a south-east step $1+q+\dots+q^{\lfloor\frac{h}{2}\rfloor}$,
  where
  $h$ is the height of the step.

\item multiply the weight of each of the $n$ south-east steps by $1-q$, which
  means that the weight of a south-east step is now
  $1-q^{\lfloor\frac{h}{2}\rfloor}$.

\item We factorise the Dyck paths as in Jean-Guy Penaud's proof.  This leads us
  to the language ($n$ is north-east, $s$ south-east, $\bar s$ weighted
  south-east)

  \begin{align}
    P&=n\bar s (1+P) + n Q \bar s (1+P) + n Q s (1+P)\\
    Q&=n\bar s (1+Q) + n P \bar s (1+Q) + n P s (1+Q).
  \end{align}

  Therefrom we obtain the following pair of functional equations, where $t$
  marks the length of the path:

  \begin{align}\label{eq:system}
    \frac{P(z)}{1+P(z)}&=yt\left((1+qz)Q(z)+qz\right)\\
    \frac{Q(z)}{1+Q(z)}&=t\left((1+qz)P(qz)+qz\right).
  \end{align}

  $z$ is a catalytic variable, that is a multiplicative factor for the weight
  of the paths.  Thus, we want to determine $P(-1)$.
\end{itemize}

We now have to solve \ref{eq:system}.  To this end, we eliminate $Q$, and then
make the following Ansatz: set $P(z)=yt\frac{R(z)-1}{1+yt}$ and finally
$R(z)=\frac{H(qz)}{H(z)}$.  This yields the following second order homogeneous
linear ordinary $q$-differential equation:
\begin{equation}
y(1+qz) t^2 H(q^2 z)+((y+1)qz t-yt^2-1)H(qz)+(1+qz) H(z)=0  
\end{equation}

This can be solved with standard methods (is this true?) and yields

\begin{verbatim}
          [                       ]
          | -t, -(t y)            |
H[z]=  ph |           ; q, -(q z) |
      2  1|      2                |
          [   q t  y              ]
\end{verbatim}

\end{document}

great!

yes, that sounds plausible.
