<center><b><font size=+1>Dinosaur Crocodile</font></b>
<br><b>By Alexandra Prellberg</b>

<p>One day the crocodile was looking for a dinosaur. It was a tyrannosaurus
Rex. It was so sad that it couldn't even find one because it wanted to
have a baby. So it found something - one tyrannosaurus rex - and it said
"I'm going to marry the crocodile so I guess I will do it then."
<p>So it went and said "Hello can I marry you" and it said "sure because
I think you are a nice crocodile. We can marry each other because I want
to have a baby." And so they did it.
<p>So the tyrannosaurus rex was the mommy and the crocodile was the papa
and they wanted to have a baby duck and a baby hen and a baby frog and
the crocodile didn't want to eat it or scare it. So then they colored stars
or hearts or pictures of themselves.
