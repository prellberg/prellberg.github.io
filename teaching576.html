<FONT SIZE=+1>Target Audience:</FONT>
Advanced undergraduate students /
graduate students without background in solid state physics
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Course Description:</FONT> 
The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to solid state physics. 
It is intended to both acquaint the student with the basic concepts in this field and to
give an overview of the broad range of topics usually associated with solid state physics.<BR>
<P>
Topics covered include<BR>
- The Materials and Methods of Solid State Physics<BR>
- Crystallography<BR>
- Diffraction<BR>
- Defects in Crystals<BR>
- Lattice Vibrations<BR>
- Metallic Behavior and the Free Electron Gas<BR>
- The Periodic Potential<BR>
- The Cohesion of Pure Metals<BR>
- Sone Physical Properties of Metals<BR>
- Semiconductors<BR>
- Magnetism<BR>
- Dielectric Media<BR>
- Superconductivity<BR>
and, if time permits<BR>
- Aspects of Surface Physics<BR>
- The Nucleus and Solid State Physics<BR>
