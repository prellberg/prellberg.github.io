Mathematical Methods for Physicists, 4th edition, by George B. Arfken and Hans J. Weber
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Course Description:</FONT> 
The purpose of this course is to provide the mathematical tools necessary for doing physics.
The emphasis will be on problem solving, so the lectures will deal with the structure of 
the mathematics involved rather than with formal proofs. About half of the course will be spent
on solving problems and discussing solutions. I intend to cover most of the topics in the text book.
This course is part of the preparation for the qualifying exam.
